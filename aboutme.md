subtitle: A little backstory
---

My name is Samuel, I grew up in Montreal, NDG for most of my life but spent the majority of my high school years in Kuujjuaq where I spent the majority of my free time studying

languages such as python and bash as well as learning configuration management tools such as ansible and container technologies such as Docker, BSD jails, LXC and KVM.

My favourite operating system, FreeBSD, is what I enjoy putting most of my free time contributing to, specifically the documentation side of things if it can be helped.

I first installed Linux and started studying Linux and the relevant technologies when I was 13 where I got my first job as a dish washer working from 4pm(after school) to 8pm, monday to friday in order to purchase my first laptop.
